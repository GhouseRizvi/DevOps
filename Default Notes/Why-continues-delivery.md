Continues delivery is an automated process of  delivery code changes to the severs in a quickly efficiently at a enormous phase.

# The Process
Code commits automated and build process at ease and the goal of ci to detect  issues early. This document describes how we approach this of Creating a New Post in WordPress of Writing a Blog Posting Language is a flexible,

CI process generates the build regularly. It is triggered by changes to any file in the repository, and it runs on a continuous integration server.

Deployment
Every steps in deployment should be automated
Server Provisioning
Dependencies
config changes
Network
Artifact Deploy 
Anyother changes
## Server Provisioning


Software Testing also be automated
Functional
Load
Performance
DB
Security
anyother test cases

So here 
Ops team write automation code for deployment.
Testers writes the automation code for testing.
and sync it with devloper's source code.

here in dev ops all three teams
dev ops and Qa teams are integrated together fo continues delivery process.

## INTEGRATION
- Code 
- Code build & Test
- Code Analysis
- Artifact Repo.
